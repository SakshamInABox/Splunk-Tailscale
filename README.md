# Splunk2Tailscale
Making [Splunk Enterprise](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/splunk-enterprise.html) accessible through [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/).

### Use case
Working collaboratively on a one-off investigation which involves a lot of log files? This setup allows you to quickly spin up a disposable Splunk Enterprise server, where you can upload log files to and share the Splunk instance to an invited guest on your [Tailnet](https://tailscale.com/kb/1136/tailnet/).

### Usage
